Set up RabbitMQ as the Message Broker

Install RabbitMQ:

On Windows, you can download the installer from the RabbitMQ official website.

Enable STOMP Plugin: By default, RabbitMQ uses AMQP, but it also supports STOMP via a plugin. Enable the STOMP plugin by running:

sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_stomp
Start RabbitMQ: Start the RabbitMQ server:

On Windows: Open RabbitMQ from the Start Menu or start it as a service.

Verify the RabbitMQ Status: You can check if RabbitMQ is running with:
sudo rabbitmqctl status
Running RabbitMQ Management Interface (Optional)
RabbitMQ provides a web-based management UI to monitor your queues and exchanges.

Enable the management plugin:
sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management

Access the management console by visiting http://localhost:15672. The default login credentials are:
Username: guest
Password: guest

4. Run the Services

Start the Publisher (Service A):
In a terminal, navigate to the service_a folder and run the publisher.py script:
cd service_a
python publisher.py
This will send messages to the test-queue on RabbitMQ.

Start the Consumer (Service B):
Open a new terminal, navigate to the service_b folder
and run the consumer.py script:
cd service_b
python consumer.py
This will start the consumer, which will listen for messages on the test-queue. When messages are sent by the publisher, they will be printed out by the consumer.



5. Test the Setup
Publisher (Service A) will send 5 test messages (one every 2 seconds) to the test-queue.
Consumer (Service B) will receive and print those messages as they arrive.
For example, the consumer's output might look like this:

Received message: Test message 1
Received message: Test message 2
Received message: Test message 3
Received message: Test message 4
Received message: Test message 5



6. Scaling and Enhancing the System

This basic setup demonstrates how two services can communicate via a message broker using the STOMP protocol. You can extend the setup to have multiple consumers, publishers, and different queues/topics based on your application's requirements.

Here are a few ways to enhance this system:

Multiple queues: Add more services, each working with different queues.
Error handling: Implement error handling in the Publisher and Consumer classes to manage broker downtime or connection issues.
Acknowledgment: Modify the consumer to use manual acknowledgment (ack=client) for better control over message processing.
Message persistence: Configure RabbitMQ to ensure messages are durable (survive broker restarts).
